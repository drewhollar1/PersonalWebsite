            <p>Discover the intersection of technology and fitness through my work on a Machine Learning Fitness Tracker,
            a highlight of my project portfolio. This project is capable or taking accelerometer and gyroscope data and using it for
            innovative health and fitness solutions.
            By employing feature engineering and predictive modeling, including techniques like Fourier transformation
            and random forest algorithms, I have created a way to succesfully track various barbell exercises. Learn more about this
            project and the others I have worked on <a href="projects.html">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Originating from Harrisonburg and currently a student at the University of Virginia, my journey in computer
            science has been challenging but I have learned a lot. Beyond the classroom, I serve as the Secretary of the Trigon
            Engineering Society, engaging in community and professional development activities. My projects, including a
            web-based event coordinator platform for UVA and an interactive cryptocurrency dashboard, reflect my commitment to
            applying technical knowledge to real-world problems. Learn more about my background <a href="about.html">here.</a>
