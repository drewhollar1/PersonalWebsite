                            <p class="card-text">I developed a Python-based Machine Learning Fitness Tracker leveraging accelerometer and gyroscope data to
                            accurately count repetitions and differentiate between five strength training exercises. I employed advanced feature
                            engineering techniques like window-based mean, Fourier transformation, and K-means clustering for data optimization,
                            followed by predictive modeling utilizing various algorithms including neural networks, random forests, and decision
                            trees, with random forest yielding the best results. It was awesome being able to solve a practical issue in my life through machine learning.
                            In the future I could design a UI for this program so that it could be used with a wearable accessory.</p>

                            Django framework and Heroku for database management, our team integrated Google Maps, Google Geocoding, and Google Login API to
                            offer authenticated users real-time location data of ongoing events. As the Scrum Master, I led the team in adhering to
                            the Scrum methodology, organizing sprints to guarantee prompt and effective project completion, and fostering an agile
                            development atmosphere. The site has not been maintained in a while so it might not be working perfectly currently.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">I crafted an engaging cryptocurrency dashboard using JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS to offer users a
                            dynamic interface. By integrating Rapid API's Crypto News Live & Alpha Vantage, I ensured users had access to up-to-date
                            cryptocurrency news and real-time exchange rates for popular cryptocurrencies. It should be noted that the styling for this dashboard is not finished! 
                            I may go back and finish it later but the point of this project was to improve my ability to implement and utilize existing API's so styling was not my main priority.
                            As a result project is not ready for presentation but it does function.</p>

                            narrative illustrated through data visualizations. I've broken down the demographics of survey participants,
                            showcasing distributions across countries and average ages.
                            I tried to use a variety of graphing techniques such as using gauge charts to reflect satisfaction levels with work-life balance and salaries.
                            I did this project to become more familiar with using Power BI to effectively visualize data.</p>

                            UVA Dorm Rater, was created in collaboration with another UVA student to provide an insightful resource for prospective University of Virginia
                            students by presenting reviews of the UVA dorm experience. Offering
                            functionality like account management, dorm-specific reviews, and a voting system, the site ensures users can not only
                            share their experiences but also find the most useful reviews quickly. We developed the platform with a robust front-end
                            that communicates with a PHP backend to ensure an asynchronous, smooth user experience, including features like dorm
                            search and automatic review sorting. Currently only the front-end is finished, the project is expected to be completed sometime in April.

                        Leveraging the latest advancements in AI, I'm currently developing an intelligent chatbot for my personal website.Powered by Google's Dialogflow, it processes natural language
                        queries with precision, ensuring users receive accurate and relevant information. The backend, built on the robust
                        FastAPI framework, promises swift and reliable responses, while an SQL database underpins the system, managing dynamic
                        data with efficiency. There no current hard deadline for this chatbot, but I plan to work on it next chance I get.

                        In a forward-thinking academic project, my team and I embarked on the conceptualization of HoosBudget, an innovative UI
                        for a student-focused budgeting app imagined for the UVA community. This theoretical application was meticulously
                        designed through an iterative cycle of user experience research methods, including contextual inquiries, workflow
                        analysis, and prototype refinements. Through methods like flow models, we mapped out a user interface that seamlessly
                        integrates the financial nuances of college life, from splitting rent and utility bills to managing academic expenses.
                        The final UI design should be complete by the end of April.
